# Spreadsheets as Maps

## Map Elements

Think of a map file like an Excel spreadsheet:

**Map** = an Excel workbook file. 

**Layer** = a tab/sheet within the file. 

**Features** = the rows within a tab. 

**Fields** = the columns for each row in that sheet. 

[Here]('/data.xlsx') is an example file to download.
